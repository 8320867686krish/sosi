Organotin compounds have been used as anti-fouling paint on ships' bottoms, and the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (AFS Convention, as amended) stipulates that all ships shall not apply or reapply organotin compounds after 1 January 2003, and that, after 1 January 2008, all ships shall either not bear such compounds on their hulls or shall bear a coating that forms a barrier preventing such compounds from leaching into the sea. The above-mentioned dates may have been extended by permission of the Administration bearing in mind that the AFS Convention entered into force on 17 September 2008.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Working Procedure </h3>
        <p>In order to create checks for the Visual Sampling Check Plan (VSCP) the following flow chart is referenced which is provided in MEPC 379(80) guidelines for preparation of the IHM.</p>

        <div style="text-align:justify;padding:10px">
            <p>1. Documents may include certificates, manuals, ship’s plans drawings, technical specifications and information from sister and/or similar ships.</p>

            <p>2. The assessment should cover all materials listed in table A of Appendix 1 of the Guideline; the control areas listed in table B should be assessed as practicable.<br />It is assumed not to be able to contain hazardous materials described above for areas assessed not equivalent listed in table 5 should be used as far as available.<br />Where possible additional documents related to knowledge gained during previous assessments may be used based on knowledge and logic.</p>

            <p>3. Equipment must be made clear which cannot and/or are area specific. It must be system and/or areas which cannot be specified shall be included in the record of the assessment.In addition, system scope of this assessment can become continuous sampling listed in Appendix 1 of these guidelines on a basis of the results just taken. In the conclusion, this document system incorporates documentation containing List required equipment/materials necessary to perform testing on the equipment. Each piece of equipment is an operational state efficiency at peak working hours each day before it is impossible to assess all equipment without compromising ship safety without operational efficiency.</p>

            <p>4. When assessing pieces that incorporate sampling identification badges/documents can also take into account age and tech state by comparing materials used in Appendix 1 List for classification systems with those currently present. In the prerequisite for this assessment method are described how best testing techniques are made more comprehensive by checking history records required hazardous material’s disposal documentation contained in appendix systems should also consider current “as is” position or any changes that have been made since last checked.</p>

            <p>5. When equipment, systems and/or area of ship are not accessible for visual check or sampling checks, this equipment system and/or area is classified as ‘Potentially Containing Hazardous Materials (PCHM)’</p>
